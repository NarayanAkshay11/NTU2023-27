# Helpful Tips for Lab

### DO A FREE ACCESS SESSION BEFORE THE ACTUAL LAB

### Continuation of Lab 1 : Not necessarily, just start from scratch, only have to set-up pins again (UART)

## Other tips

#### Run SerialPlot as administrator
#### If you code doesn't seem to work uncomment the first function in main() [it gives a software led restart]
#### If it still doesn't work, remove all the wires and connect again [Hardware reset]
#### If it still doesn't seem to work, add an HAL_Delay()

#### Use sprintf properly, add all values into a single sentence and Transmit together for a better graph on SerialPlot
#### Understand why IMU_Addr is given a certain value & why specific registers are used (Comes for the quiz 99% of the time)
